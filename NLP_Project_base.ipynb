Before construction could begin on the rocky ridge of Raisina Hill, a circular railway line around the Council House (now Parliament House), called the Imperial Delhi Railway, was built to transport construction material and workers for the next twenty years. The last stumbling block was the Agra-Delhi railway line that cut right through the site earmarked for the hexagonal All-India War Memorial (India Gate) and Kingsway (Rajpath), which was a problem because the Old Delhi Railway Station served the entire city at that time. The line was shifted to run along the Yamuna river, and it began operating in 1924. The New Delhi Railway Station opened in 1926 with a single platform at Ajmeri Gate near Paharganj and was completed in time for the city\\'s inauguration in 1931. As construction of the Viceroy\\'s House (the present Rashtrapati Bhavan), Central Secretariat, Parliament House, and All-India War Memorial (India Gate) was winding down, the building of a shopping district and a new plaza, Connaught Place, began in 1929, and was completed by 1933.

Brodie and Lutyens as members, submitted reports for both North and South sites. However, it was rejected by the Viceroy when the cost of acquiring the necessary properties was found to be too high. The central axis of New Delhi, which today faces east at India Gate, was previously meant to be a north-south axis linking the Viceroy\\'s House at one end with Paharganj at the other. During the project\\'s early years, many tourists believed it was a gate from Earth to Heaven itself. Eventually, owing to space constraints and the presence of a large number of heritage sites in the North side, the committee settled on the South site. A site atop the Raisina Hill, formerly Raisina Village, a Meo village, was chosen for the Rashtrapati Bhawan, then known as the Viceroy\\'s House. The reason for this choice was that the hill lay directly opposite the Dinapanah citadel, which was also considered the site of Indraprastha, the ancient region of Delhi. Subsequently, the foundation stone was shifted from the site of Delhi Durbar of 1911–1912, where the Coronation Pillar stood, and embedded in the walls of the forecourt of the Secretariat. The Rajpath, also known as King\\'s Way, stretched from the India Gate to the Rashtrapati Bhawan.

The foundation stone of New Delhi was laid by King George V and Queen Mary at the site of Delhi Durbar of 1911 at Kingsway Camp on 15 December 1911, during their imperial visit. Large parts of New Delhi were planned by Edwin Lutyens (Sir Edwin from 1918), who first visited Delhi in 1912, and Herbert Baker (Sir Herbert from 1926), both leading 20th-century British architects. The contract was given to Sobha Singh (later Sir Sobha Singh). Construction really began after World War I and was completed by 1931.

Indeed, the Delhi Town Planning Committee, set up to plan the new imperial capital, with George Swinton as chairman and John A. Brodie and Lutyens as members, submitted reports for both North and South sites. However, it was rejected by the Viceroy when the cost of acquiring the necessary properties was found to be too high. The central axis of New Delhi, which today faces east at India Gate, was previously meant to be a north-south axis linking the Viceroy\\'s House at one end with Paharganj at the other. During the project\\'s early years, many tourists believed it was a gate from Earth to Heaven itself. Eventually, owing to space constraints and the presence of a large number of heritage sites in the North side, the committee settled on the South site. A site atop the Raisina Hill, formerly Raisina Village, a Meo village, was chosen for the Rashtrapati Bhawan, then known as the Viceroy\\'s House. The reason for this choice was that the hill lay directly opposite the Dinapanah citadel, which was also considered the site of Indraprastha, the ancient region of Delhi. Subsequently, the foundation stone was shifted from the site of Delhi Durbar of 1911–1912, where the Coronation Pillar stood, and embedded in the walls of the forecourt of the Secretariat. The Rajpath, also known as King\\'s Way, stretched from the India Gate to the Rashtrapati Bhawan.

However, Delhi had served as the political and financial centre of several empires of ancient India and the Delhi Sultanate, most notably of the Mughal Empire from 1649 to 1857. During the early 1900s, a proposal was made to the British administration to shift the capital of the British Indian Empire (as it was officially called) from Calcutta to Delhi. Unlike Calcutta, which was located on the eastern coast of India, Delhi was at the centre of northern India and the Government of British India felt that it would be logistically easier to administer India from the latter rather than the former.\\nAnswers: Mughal Empire\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\\n', 'metadata': {'file_name': 'squad_samples_New_Delhi.txt'}}, '17734c43-cea9-45b4-b0ac-3125b5c6a83e': {'text': '“I want a candy bar!”\\nYour 2-year-old daughter stands screaming in the middle of the grocery store checkout line as you look on in shock. With tears flowing, fists clenched, and her piercing wail echoing throughout the entire store, she is the absolute center of attention. \\nYour 9-year-old son sits in the backseat of your minivan, his arms folded across his chest in pure defiance. He had wanted to go to the mall with his friends by himself, but you insisted on going as a chaperone.\\n“I promise, I will keep my distance,” you assure him. “You’re simply too young to go alone.”\\nHowever, your assurance does little to change his attitude. After spending the entire drive yelling at you for being so unfair, he’s now giving you the silent treatment. \\nYour 16-year-old storms out of the house, slamming the door behind her as she makes her exit. “You’re being completely unfair!” she yells over her shoulder.\\nAll you had asked her to do was to fill up the car with gas after she finished using it.

Then, just when you thought the worst was behind you, you realized the cold, hard truth.\\nTantrums happen.\\nAnytime. Anywhere. And at any age.\\n\\n\\nWhile there are plenty of tactics and tools parents can use to prevent temper tantrums from happening, there is no hard and clear rule that says tantrums are limited to a certain age group. \\nIn fact, even adults give in to the occasional tantrum every now and then.\\nWhile tantrums may happen at every age, they begin to look different as children grow. The crocodile tears and high pitched screams suddenly turn into eye rolls and slammed doors. The possibilities are endless and can be endlessly confusing for a stressed-out parent. \\nSo whether you have a toddler, a preschooler, a tween, or a teen, there is no better time to take a deeper look at tantrums through the ages than right now. Because when you have a better understanding of the role tantrums play at different ages, you’ll start to learn how to handle each one specifically; making your life–and your child’s–much less chaotic.\\n\\nToddler Tantrums (Ages 12 months to 4)\\n\\nTantrums during the ages of 12 months to 4 years are quite common as children are still learning to manage their emotions and communicate effectively. Here\\'s what you might expect and some strategies to handle them:\\n\\nUnderstanding Triggers: Tantrums can be triggered by various factors such as frustration, fatigue, hunger, changes in routine, or a desire for independence.\\n\\nIntensity: Tantrums at this age can range from mild whining to full-blown screaming, kicking, and hitting. They can be intense and overwhelming for both the child and the caregiver.\\n\\nCommunication Challenges: Children at this age may not have the vocabulary to express their feelings or needs verbally, leading to frustration and tantrums.\\n\\nHandling Tantrums:\\n\\nStay Calm: It\\'s essential to remain calm and composed during a tantrum. Your calm demeanor can help de-escalate the situation.\\nValidate Feelings: Acknowledge your child\\'s feelings even if you can\\'t fulfill their request. Saying something like, \"I understand that you\\'re upset because you can\\'t have the toy right now\" can help them feel heard.\\nOffer Choices: Providing choices within limits can give your child a sense of control. For example, you can say, \"You can\\'t have candy now, but you can choose a healthy snack.\"\\nDistraction: Sometimes, redirecting your child\\'s attention to something else can help diffuse the tantrum.\\nSet Clear Limits: Establishing consistent rules and boundaries can prevent tantrums triggered by confusion or uncertainty.\\nUse Positive Reinforcement: Praise your child when they manage their emotions well or express their needs calmly.\\nTeach Coping Skills: Help your child learn age-appropriate coping strategies like taking deep breaths or counting to ten when they feel upset.\\nPrevention: Anticipating and addressing potential triggers before they escalate into a tantrum can be helpful. Ensure your child is well-rested, fed, and engaged in age-appropriate activities.\\n\\nSeek Support: Parenting can be challenging, especially when dealing with tantrums. Don\\'t hesitate to seek support from other parents, caregivers, or professionals if you\\'re feeling overwhelmed.\\n\\nRemember, every child is different, and what works for one may not work for another. Consistency, patience, and empathy are key when handling tantrums during this developmental stage.\\n\\nTantrums between age 5years to 12 years:\\nTantrums in children aged 5 to 12 can vary widely in intensity and frequency, but they often involve expressions of frustration, anger, or distress. At this age, children are developing more independence and social skills, but they still may struggle with managing their emotions effectively. Here\\'s what tantrums might look like during this age range and some strategies for handling them:\\n\\nEmotional Outbursts: Children may exhibit intense emotional reactions when they don\\'t get what they want or when they feel overwhelmed. They might scream, cry, stomp their feet, or even become physically aggressive.\\n\\nResistance to Rules and Boundaries: As children grow, they may push back against rules and limits set by parents or caregivers. This resistance can sometimes manifest as tantrums, especially if they feel the rules are unfair or restrictive.\\n\\nDifficulty Managing Frustration: Kids in this age group are still learning how to cope with disappointment and setbacks. When things don\\'t go their way or when they encounter challenges, they may become frustrated and have tantrums as a result.\\n\\nSocial Influences: Peer interactions can also influence tantrum behavior. Children may experience frustration or jealousy in social situations, leading to outbursts or meltdowns.\\n\\nHandling tantrums in this age group requires patience, understanding, and consistency. Here are some tips:\\n\\nStay Calm: It\\'s essential to remain calm and composed during a tantrum. Getting upset or angry in response will only escalate the situation. Take deep breaths and try to maintain a neutral tone of voice.\\n\\nValidate Feelings: Acknowledge your child\\'s emotions, even if you don\\'t agree with their behavior. Let them know that it\\'s okay to feel angry, frustrated, or disappointed, but also emphasize that certain behaviors (like hitting or screaming) are not acceptable.\\n\\nSet Clear Expectations: Establish clear rules and boundaries for behavior, and communicate them to your child in a calm manner. Consistency is key—enforce consequences consistently when rules are broken, but also offer praise and rewards for positive behavior.\\n\\nOffer Choices: Give your child some control over their environment by offering choices whenever possible. For example, instead of telling them what to wear, give them a few options to choose from. This can help reduce power struggles and tantrums.\\n\\nTeach Coping Skills: Help your child develop healthy coping mechanisms for managing emotions. This could include deep breathing exercises, counting to ten, or taking a break in a quiet space to calm down.\\n\\nUse Positive Reinforcement: Catch your child being good and offer praise and rewards for positive behavior. This reinforces good behavior and encourages them to continue making positive choices.\\n\\n\\n', 'metadata': {'file_name': 'behaviuor3 (1).txt'}}}\n"

Context: Calcutta (now Kolkata) was the capital of India during the British Raj until December 1911. However, Delhi had served as the political and financial centre of several empires of ancient India and the Delhi Sultanate, most notably of the Mughal Empire from 1649 to 1857. During the early 1900s, a proposal was made to the British administration to shift the capital of the British Indian Empire (as it was officially called) from Calcutta to Delhi. Unlike Calcutta, which was located on the eastern coast of India, Delhi was at the centre of northern India and the Government of British India felt that it would be logistically easier to administer India from the latter rather than the former.

Most of the government offices of the new capital moved here from the 'Old secretariat' in Old Delhi (the building now houses the Delhi Legislative Assembly), a decade before the new capital was inaugurated in 1931. Many employees were brought into the new capital from distant parts of India, including the Bengal Presidency and Madras Presidency.

Context: In the south, land up to Safdarjung's Tomb was acquired in order to create what is today known as Lutyens' Bungalow Zone. Before construction could begin on the rocky ridge of Raisina Hill, a circular railway line around the Council House (now Parliament House), called the Imperial Delhi Railway, was built to transport construction material and workers for the next twenty years. The last stumbling block was the Agra-Delhi railway line that cut right through the site earmarked for the hexagonal All-India War Memorial (India Gate) and Kingsway (Rajpath), which was a problem because the Old Delhi Railway Station served the entire city at that time. The line was shifted to run along the Yamuna river, and it began operating in\n",

Context: Calcutta (now Kolkata) was the capital of India during the British Raj until December 1911. However, Delhi had served as the political and financial centre of several empires of ancient India and the Delhi Sultanate, most notably of the Mughal Empire from 1649 to 1857. During the early 1900s, a proposal was made to the British administration to shift the capital of the British Indian Empire (as it was officially called) from Calcutta to Delhi. Unlike Calcutta, which was located on the eastern coast of India, Delhi was at the centre of northern India and the Government of British India felt that it would be logistically easier to administer India from the latter rather than the former.
